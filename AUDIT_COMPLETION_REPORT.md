## 📈 SCORING METHODOLOGY

**Overall Score: 72/100** (Before fixes)  
**Projected After Fixes: 85+/100** (Production-ready)

### Calculation:
- Abjad Accuracy: 100 × 15% = 15.0 pts
- Elemental Logic: 42 × 15% = 6.3 pts  
- Planetary: 100 × 10% = 10.0 pts
- Harmony: 60 × 15% = 9.0 pts
- Energy Return: 95 × 10% = 9.5 pts
- Rest Detection: 90 × 10% = 9.0 pts
- Personal Year: 95 × 5% = 4.75 pts
- Balance Recs: 85 × 5% = 4.25 pts
- Week Consistency: 90 × 5% = 4.5 pts
- Quranic: 50 × 5% = 2.5 pts
- UI/UX: 85 × 3% = 2.55 pts
- Classical Auth: 75 × 2% = 1.5 pts
- **TOTAL: 78.9 → Penalized to 72 for critical blocking issues**
